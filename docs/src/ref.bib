abstract = {This contribution presents the results of a numerical study of karst denudation on limestone plateaux. The landscape evolution model used incorporates not only long-range fluvial and short-range hill-slope processes, but also large-scale chemical dissolution of limestone surfaces. The relative efficiencies of fluvial and chemical processes are of equal importance to the landscape evolution of a plateau dropping to sea level along an escarpment. While fluvial processes have an impact confined mostly to river channels, the karst denudation process is more uniform, removing material also from the plateau surface. The combined effect of both processes results in a landscape evolution almost twice as effective as the purely erosional evolution of an insoluble landscape.},

	abstract = {Numerical models of complex Earth systems serve two important purposes. First, they embody quantitative hypotheses about those systems and thus help researchers develop insight and generate testable predictions. Second, in a more pragmatic context, numerical models are often called upon as quantitative decision-support tools. In geomorphology, mathematical and numerical models provide a crucial link between small-scale, measurable processes and their long-term geomorphic implications. In recent years, several models have been developed that simulate the structure and evolution of three-dimensional fluvial terrain as a consequence of different process “laws” (e.g., Willgoose et al., 1991a; Beaumont et al., 1992; Chase, 1992; Anderson, 1994; Howard, 1994; Tucker and Slingerland, 1994; Moglen and Bras, 1995). By providing the much-needed connection between measurable processes and the dynamics of long-term landscape evolution that these processes drive, mathematical landscape models have posed challenging new hypotheses and have provided the guiding impetus behind new quantitative field studies and Digital Elevation Model ({DEM}) -based analyses of terrain (e.g., Snyder et al., 2000). The current generation of models, however, shares a number of important limitations. Most models rely on a highly simplified representation of drainage basin hydrology, treating climate through a simple “perpetual runoff” formulation.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new computational model designed to simulate and investigate reach-scale alluvial dynamics within a landscape evolution model. The model is based on the cellular automaton concept, whereby the continued iteration of a series of local process ‘rules’ governs the behaviour of the entire system. The model is a modified version of the {CAESAR} landscape evolution model, which applies a suite of physically based rules to simulate the entrainment, transport and deposition of sediments. The {CAESAR} model has been altered to improve the representation of hydraulic and geomorphic processes in an alluvial environment. In-channel and overbank flow, sediment entrainment and deposition, suspended load and bed load transport, lateral erosion and bank failure have all been represented as local cellular automaton rules. Although these rules are relatively simple and straightforward, their combined and repeatedly iterated effect is such that complex, non-linear geomorphological response can be simulated within the model. Examples of such larger-scale, emergent responses include channel incision and aggradation, terrace formation, channel migration and river meandering, formation of meander cutoffs, and transitions between braided and single-thread channel patterns. In the current study, the model is illustrated on a reach of the River Teifi, near Lampeter, Wales, {UK}.},

	abstract = {In situ cosmogenic nuclides are widely employed to quantify topographic and geomorphic landscape evolution. However, few studies are devoted to investigating possibly unsteady denudation. In this work the denudation rates of five surface bedrock and one depth profile are measured using in situ cosmogenic 36Cl in different climate zones in China; cosmogenic 36Cl is a powerful proxy for the surface denudation processes of carbonate landscapes in different climatic gradients since carbonates are more sensitive to climate change than silicates. Compiling previous worldwide surface denudation studies in different gradients, we find that: (I) denudation rate increases systematically with mean annual precipitation ({MAP}) in arid climatic zones ({MAP} lower than {\textasciitilde}700 mm yr−1) and is dominated by long-term climatic gradients; ({II}) humid climatic zone ({MAP} greater than {\textasciitilde}700 mm yr−1) denudation rates are about constrained to 34.1 ± 11.7 mm kyr−1 by carbonate dissolution kinetics; and ({III}) denudation rate is also influenced by short-term physical erosion or abrupt erosive events. Accordingly, the reconstructed evolutionary history of the Guizhou depth profile results from either a relatively high denudation rate (55.5–4.4 +5.6 mm kyr−1) and long duration exposure (274–147 +120 ka), or an alternative a low denudation rate (0.8–0.8 +13.3 mm kyr−1) and a recent abrupt erosive event (13.0–1.6 +1.9 ka). These two possible solutions suggest that assumed long-term averaged denudation rate can conceal episodic erosion events. Given tectonic quiescence we propose that climate change might mainly control an erosive event during the last glacial termination ({\textasciitilde}14 ka), which also implies that caution should be taken when determining the denudation rate of a landscape where climate change and/or tectonic activity plays an important role.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of carbonate-dominated landscapes is still debated, and first-order questions pertaining to the respective importance of chemical and mechanical weathering processes or the influence of climatic variability on denudation rates are largely open. To address these issues, we investigate the denudation pattern across a climatic gradient in Provence, {SE} France. We focused on a series of major carbonate mountain ranges with elevation spanning 200 to 2000 m and associated with {\textgreater}2-fold variations in mean annual temperature and precipitation. We collected 25 samples from 10 different mountain ranges and quantified denudation rates through the measurement of their 36Cl concentrations in order to explore tectonic and climatic controls on these carbonate landscapes evolution. We observe that most of our samples experience denudation rates in the 30–60 mm/ka range (averaged over 5 to 40 ka), with no evident dependence on variations of mean annual temperature or precipitation. One range (Lure mountain) stands out as a significant outlier, with much higher denudation rates ({\textgreater}100 mm/ka) than adjacent sites (Ventoux mountain) at the same elevation and experiencing similar present-day environmental conditions. We explore in details the climatic, tectonic and geomorphological contexts of these two ranges in order to understand the reasons for this apparent 3-fold difference in denudation rates. A regionally-documented major Holocene hillslope destabilization event appears to be a likely candidate to explain the observed lower 36Cl concentrations at the top of the Lure mountain. At longer wavelengths, our regional dataset shows no clear control of modern precipitation gradients on denudation rates, consistent with previous observations in landscapes underlain by other lithologies.},

	abstract = {The development of a karst landscape results from complex interactions between lithology, climate, hydrology, soil, vegetation and tectonics. Weathering and erosion of carbonate rocks leads to denudation of karst landscapes. As dissolution of carbonate rocks is often considered to be the main process governing carbonate weathering, other processes are often overlooked. Here we present research done in the North Dalmatian Plain, a carbonate erosive surface located in the Dinaric karst region. Although the study site is composed of two different carbonate lithologies having different weathering style, there is no evident lithological impact on the topography of the erosive surface. Analyses of 36Cl concentration were performed in ten proximal bedrock samples from both lithologies and resulted in long-term denudation rates ranging from 14.7 to 22.8 m/Ma. Since no statistical significance was found between samples from different lithologies (all samples belong to a single normal population) and they have the same geomorphological context and climate features, variable denudation rates are attributed to local (sample specific) differences. In the study site there are no large outstanding rock residuals or patches with deep soil profiles. Thus, to maintain the levelled erosive surface, local differential denudation rates have to vary with time. We hypothesize that lichens and pedogenic carbonates have a significant role in modulating local differences in denudation rates. Our study shows that even at outcrop scale those differences can be significant, and the study of sample populations is preferred to single or limited number of analyses. Thus, the long-term denudation rate of the North Dalmatian Plain, including its local variability is 18.91 ± 0.81 m/Ma. Despite classical studies on karst terrains assume that dissolution is the main process responsible for development of these landscapes, our research highlights the importance of physical weathering in combination with dissolution of carbonates as main controls on the denudation of karst landscapes.},

Sea level mirrors oxygen isotope variations, reflecting ice-volume change on the 104- to 106-year scale, but a link between oxygen isotope and sea level on the 107-year scale must be due to temperature changes that we attribute to tectonically controlled carbon dioxide variations. Sea-level change has influenced phytoplankton evolution, ocean chemistry, and the loci of carbonate, organic carbon, and siliciclastic sediment burial. Over the past 100 My, sea-level changes reflect global climate evolution from a time of ephemeral Antarctic ice sheets (100 to 33 Ma), through a time of large ice sheets primarily in Antarctica (33 to 2.5 Ma), to a world with large Antarctic and large, variable Northern Hemisphere ice sheets (2.5 Ma to the present).},
