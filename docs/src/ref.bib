	abstract = {Numerical models of complex Earth systems serve two important purposes. First, they embody quantitative hypotheses about those systems and thus help researchers develop insight and generate testable predictions. Second, in a more pragmatic context, numerical models are often called upon as quantitative decision-support tools. In geomorphology, mathematical and numerical models provide a crucial link between small-scale, measurable processes and their long-term geomorphic implications. In recent years, several models have been developed that simulate the structure and evolution of three-dimensional fluvial terrain as a consequence of different process “laws” (e.g., Willgoose et al., 1991a; Beaumont et al., 1992; Chase, 1992; Anderson, 1994; Howard, 1994; Tucker and Slingerland, 1994; Moglen and Bras, 1995). By providing the much-needed connection between measurable processes and the dynamics of long-term landscape evolution that these processes drive, mathematical landscape models have posed challenging new hypotheses and have provided the guiding impetus behind new quantitative field studies and Digital Elevation Model ({DEM}) -based analyses of terrain (e.g., Snyder et al., 2000). The current generation of models, however, shares a number of important limitations. Most models rely on a highly simplified representation of drainage basin hydrology, treating climate through a simple “perpetual runoff” formulation.},

	abstract = {The development of a karst landscape results from complex interactions between lithology, climate, hydrology, soil, vegetation and tectonics. Weathering and erosion of carbonate rocks leads to denudation of karst landscapes. As dissolution of carbonate rocks is often considered to be the main process governing carbonate weathering, other processes are often overlooked. Here we present research done in the North Dalmatian Plain, a carbonate erosive surface located in the Dinaric karst region. Although the study site is composed of two different carbonate lithologies having different weathering style, there is no evident lithological impact on the topography of the erosive surface. Analyses of 36Cl concentration were performed in ten proximal bedrock samples from both lithologies and resulted in long-term denudation rates ranging from 14.7 to 22.8 m/Ma. Since no statistical significance was found between samples from different lithologies (all samples belong to a single normal population) and they have the same geomorphological context and climate features, variable denudation rates are attributed to local (sample specific) differences. In the study site there are no large outstanding rock residuals or patches with deep soil profiles. Thus, to maintain the levelled erosive surface, local differential denudation rates have to vary with time. We hypothesize that lichens and pedogenic carbonates have a significant role in modulating local differences in denudation rates. Our study shows that even at outcrop scale those differences can be significant, and the study of sample populations is preferred to single or limited number of analyses. Thus, the long-term denudation rate of the North Dalmatian Plain, including its local variability is 18.91 ± 0.81 m/Ma. Despite classical studies on karst terrains assume that dissolution is the main process responsible for development of these landscapes, our research highlights the importance of physical weathering in combination with dissolution of carbonates as main controls on the denudation of karst landscapes.},

 abstract={We use published Pacific benthic foraminiferal oxygen isotope data and Mg/Ca records to derive a Cenozoic (66 Ma) global mean sea level (GMSL) estimate. This paper is novel in providing the first Pacific benthic foraminiferal oxygen isotopic splice for the entire Cenozoic, a detailed (Myr scale) sea-level record for the last 48 Ma based on the benthic foraminiferal oxygen isotopic and Mg/Ca approach (Mg/Ca records older than 48 Ma are uncertain). We use the 2012 Geological Time Scale (GTS), a 2-Myr smoothed paleotemperatures (Cramer et al., 2011) who used a low-pass filter that passes >80{\%} of the amplitude for frequencies <0.5/Myr (wavelength >2 Myr), ramping down to <20{\%} of the amplitude for frequencies >1.25/Myr (wavelength <0.8 Myr). We used equation 7b Cramer et al. (2011) and a simplified paleotemperature equation for benthic foraminifera T = 16.1{\textendash} 4.76 [$\delta$18Obenthic {\textendash} ($\delta$18Oseawater {\textendash} 0.27)] to solve for oxygen isotopic changes of seawater. We assume that shorter term (<2 Myr) temperature changes comprise {\textasciitilde}20{\%} of the oxygen isotopic changes of seawater changes. The resultant oxygen isotopic changes of seawater estimate was scaled to GMSL changes using a revised seawater oxygen isotopes to sea-level calibration of 0.13{\textperthousand}/10 m of Winnick and Caves (2015). Because of temperature effects notable during peak Pleistocene interglacials, we iteratively fit the last interglacial cycle to known sea level during MIS5e and applied these temperatures (1.8{\textdegree}C) to major Middle to Late Pleistocene peak interglacials, tapering the temperature from the long term estimates for the peak interglacials using a Gaussian filter. We applied an empirically correction for carbonate ion change across the Eocene-Oligocene transition, to remove an apparent warming effect of {\textasciitilde}1.5{\textdegree}C; we applied their empirical correction to the sea-level curve, reducing the amplitude by 28 meters from 34.17 to 34.30 Ma.},
