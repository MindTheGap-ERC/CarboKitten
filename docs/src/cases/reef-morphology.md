# CarboKitten is able to produce reefs with different morphology

Here we can modify the facies definition to try a test a scientific hypothesis:
Could the different carbonate platform morphology (e.g., shelf vs ramp) a result of different carbonate producer combo?

We will use the default sine sea level curve to conduct the experiment.

*Hint: ramp may suggest a relative homogenous production rate with depth, while a shelf may suggest higher production rate at shallower water depth. I.e., We need change the `production-rate` and `extinction-rate` in the facies definition.

## Ramp:


## Shelf:
