**Modeling Carbonate Platforms in Julia**

## Running

Start the Julia REPL, and get into Pkg mode by pressing `]`.

```julia
pkg> instantiate
```

more documentation to appear soon.

### Examples

You'll get the best experience by running examples from the Julia REPL. There are however also some example scripts, that should work stand-alone.

```shell
julia --project=. examples/bosscher-schlager-1992.jl
```
